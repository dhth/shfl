‚ú® Overview
---

`shfl` (short for "shuffle") helps you easily rearrange lines in a file with
simple keymaps.

ü§î Motivation
---

I like switching my tmux sessions quickly (using `tmux switch-client -t
"$session"`). The session names are stored in a local file, and I map a key to a
session on a specific line number. To easily change which session is assigned to
which line number, I needed a tool that would start up quickly and have easy
keymaps to reorder lines in a file.
